                            <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
    <p></p>
     
       <p>Warthogs may appear to be ferocious little animals, and contrary to Pumba the warthog eating worms in the Lion King, they are not carnivores. Warthogs are grazers, eating grasses, plants, berries and bark. They also use their snouts to dig up roots and bulbs</p>
   <p>Warthogs allow birds, such as the yellow hornbills, to eat parasites that live on their bodies. This symbiotic relationship allows the birds to have a constant food source and the hogs to rid themselves of pests. These rooting animals are beneficial to the land by churning up the soil and allowing it to be aerated, which aids plant growth.
      Warthogs are generally diurnal but may be active at night in West Africa, Kenya, and Zimbabwe. This is likely an adaptation to avoid the hottest hours of the day, humans and other diurnal predators, and competition for water and food.
      The main threats in eastern Africa are human-caused habitat degradation, loss and fragmentation, and competition with livestock for water and food. They may be hunted for entertainment, bush meat, skins and their tusks.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
